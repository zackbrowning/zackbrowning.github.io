Jeremy Brunk, director of the Millikin University Percussion Ensemble, commissioned and then conducted the premiere of <i>Moon Venus</i> on October 31, 2019 at Millikin University at Decetur, IL. 

<i>Moon Venus</i> (2019) was commissioned by Jeremy Brunk and the Millikin Percussion Ensemble.   The music is inspired and guided by the application of <i>feng shui</i> and astrology to the birth dates of Jeremy Brunk and James Brown.  Since the original premiere date was the birth date of the “Godfather of Soul” James Brown (May 3), additional “Browns” were added as source material (jazz musician Clifford Brown and reggae artist Dennis Brown).  Through this process six themes were composed and connected to the funk of James Brown. They are “Jeremy Brunk’s Jam” (<i>feng shui</i> on his birth date); “James Brown’s Bag” (<i>feng shui</i> on his birth date); “Venus Variations” (on James Brown’s <i>Funky Drummer</i> and his ruling planet Venus); “Magic Moon” (on the ruling planet of Jeremy Brunk); “Clifford Brown’s Bop” (on the bass line of his composition <i>Sandu</i>); and “Dennis Brown’s Beat” (on the reggae beat of his composition <i>Revolution</i>). These themes are dynamically juxtaposed within a structure derived from the Magic Squares of the Moon and of Venus to create a cosmic celebration of life.
