Teaching Philosophy

I believe the true education is self education. As a teacher I try to evoke the love and enthusiasm of music within each student, to give tools to think beyond music theory and textbooks. I try to encourage students to challenge themselves by avoiding force of habits and explore new possibilities. I try to introduce more concepts and ideas to expand their horizon of music.
