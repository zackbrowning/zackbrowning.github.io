      content: "When not composing music Zack Browning teaches at the University of Illinois.  Several of the cuts on Banjaxed use the magic square as a structural device.  The magic square is a grid of numbers that all add up to the same sum, whether one adds the rows, the columns, or the diagonal lines.  You canâ€™t hear this, of course, but I suppose it helped Browning organize his musical thoughts.  All of the tracks are electro-acoustic.  The acoustic instruments include trumpet, violin, alto saxophone, flute, and mixed ensemble.  Browning combines pop and classical ideas.  I complained in the last issue that this rarely works, but Browning seems to have pulled it off.  Each piece has the thematic consistency of a pop tune.  They are all instantly identifiable, with the same production polish and narrow dynamic range as most pop records. Browning blends all of this with the creative and structural sophistication of classical music.  One of the best pieces is the first one, Breakpoint Screamer.  It is an apt title for this edgy, but cool work.  The musicians breathe fire like a dragon, singeing but never burning.  I also enjoyed the title track, which might be the aural equivalent of the pinball machine.  Imagine sassy, brilliant bumpers with each slam of the ball sending a glitter of lights and mechanical twitters through your chest.  Electro-acoustic aficionados should definitely check this out."
