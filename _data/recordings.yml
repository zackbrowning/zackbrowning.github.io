      content: “World wise contemporary classical music with a rock attitude. Browning is the kitchen sink kind of composer that can mix Oriental modes with crime jazz in the same measure and make your head spin without giving you vertigo.  Wild and wooly but still sitting down music, this almost feels like a grand 50s soundtrack by Bernstein if he was really given the chance to go off the hook for a French new wave art film. A massive ear opener, strap yourself in for a sonic good time that you almost won’t believe is happening ---all at once.”

      content: “Browning draws liberally from rock, funk, jazz, which returns all the rhythmic energy and melodic freshness… a buzzing atmosphere, which encourages others to listen to this interesting composer.”

      issue:  April 2012
      content: “This album is perfectly varied, perfectly represented by top notch ensembles, and perfectly presented. When you hold it, it just feels right as a collection of music. The title track is like an energetic, genre-crossing ensemble mixed with a 9bit video game and a trailer for a Transformers movie. It's wonderful.”

      content: “It is a music of our time…If Morton Feldman's later music felt like a leisurely scan of the patterns of a Persian rug, Zack Browning's music is like a rapid traversal of landscape changes in a low-flying jet. The results make for fascinating listening.”

      content: “Who knew squares could be so magical in compositions? Zack Browning certainly did, and in this CD he uses the 5X5 Magic Square of Mars, the 9X9 Magic Square of the Moon, and the ancient Chinese 3X3 Lo Shu Square to show how freely compositions can roam within structure. The Cadillac Moon Ensemble performs 1 and 5 (5 has elements of Van Morrison’s Moon Dance mixed in); Ensemble Unity masters 1; Jack Quartet ably executes 3; and the University of Central Florida Percussion Ensemble delights on 4 (mallets, yes!). Each group nimbly brings to life the jaunty, perky energy characteristic of this composer of “speed-demon music.” Let the classical/experimental goodness get your pulse jumping!” 
     
    - source: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about performance of Secret Pulse
      issue: February 15, 2005 
      content: “Secret Pulse, starts with taped sounds of blurry, stroboscopic electronica, augmented by live flute, cello and violin. It's way-cool in attitude, racing at top velocity, pausing only occasionally for a lyrical cello melody or pointillistic violin fragment. There's anxiety in its fast-faster-faster sensory overload, which stirred feelings of helplessness. It felt like a bleak commentary on our depersonalized, electro-computer society, where an individual's ideas are swept aside by the information-age tsunami. And it was kinda fun.” Performance by NeoPhonia Ensemble.

      issue: March, 2010
      content: “Zack Browning’s 2008 String Quartet provided just what was needed to end the program, a propulsive, giddy, rocking piece, a rush of cyclic riffs and fractured meters.”

    - source: AllMusic
      issue: December 2010
      content: “Browning clearly has a knack for creating fascinating, dynamic, and beautiful material, so that when it is run through the processes of the magic squares, the results really are wonderfully delightful and intriguing. The music is for the most part hyperkinetic, quirkily hurtling forward, with startling, unpredictable juxtapositions whose oddness is almost guaranteed to make the listener smile.”

      content: “This music is complex though not overdone, with a je-ne-sais-quoi that makes it very accessible. Highly recommended…”

      issue: August 2010
      content: “…charming, ebullient, infectiously…. Browning's rhythmic palette is so bouncy and exuberant - some of the music sounds like dance tracks for androids with varying numbers of feet - it has a seductive sort of grace.” 
      
    - source: Sonorities 
      issue: Winter 2012
      content: “This technique [magic squares] tends to produce compositions that are multi-sectional, full of variety, and pique the intellect and the ear. Or to put it another way, rather like a meal with many different courses, the pieces move from one textual or rhythmic “flavor” to another. This makes them highly accessible, and, if you are a person who thinks you do not like “modern music,” this CD might well change your mind.”

      issue: December 2010
      content: “The infectious energy, clearly inspired by pop and rock that flows from all of his compositions, in which a leading role is played by the percussion, there is no risk to disperse, as is deftly channeled by the composer in inaccessible paths, branched, but that ultimately lead us to the light.” 
      
    - source: All Music Guide
      issue: August 21, 2010
      content: “Wow, a very percussive contemporary music record - with or without percussion! Browning, an American composer, delivers here five recent works (2006/2007) plus one dating back to 1975. His music is complex, rhythm-centric, and driving. It’s easy to forget that it is mostly based on magic squares. I must mention “Profit Beater” (12 minutes) for flute and percussion, featuring the McCormick Percussion Ensemble (who recently released a CD on one of Parma’s sub-labels), and “Venus Notorious” (15 minutes) for two pianos, xylophone, and drum kit. This music is complex though not overdone, with a je-ne-sais-quoi that makes it very accessible. Highly recommended, especially to RIO fans.”

      review: The Newest Music
      author: Payton MacDonald
      content: "When not composing music Zack Browning teaches at the University of Illinois.  Several of the cuts on Banjaxed use the magic square as a structural device.  The magic square is a grid of numbers that all add up to the same sum, whether one adds the rows, the columns, or the diagonal lines.  You can’t hear this, of course, but I suppose it helped Browning organize his musical thoughts.  All of the tracks are electro-acoustic.  The acoustic instruments include trumpet, violin, alto saxophone, flute, and mixed ensemble.  Browning combines pop and classical ideas.  I complained in the last issue that this rarely works, but Browning seems to have pulled it off.  Each piece has the thematic consistency of a pop tune.  They are all instantly identifiable, with the same production polish and narrow dynamic range as most pop records. Browning blends all of this with the creative and structural sophistication of classical music.  One of the best pieces is the first one, Breakpoint Screamer.  It is an apt title for this edgy, but cool work.  The musicians breathe fire like a dragon, singeing but never burning.  I also enjoyed the title track, which might be the aural equivalent of the pinball machine.  Imagine sassy, brilliant bumpers with each slam of the ball sending a glitter of lights and mechanical twitters through your chest.  Electro-acoustic aficionados should definitely check this out."

      issue: March 7, 1998
      content: “Impact Addiction and Sole Injection, two works for live performers and tape, both highly energized pieces which represent the musicians, guided by click tracks, almost as pseudo-electronic puppets, and bringing together the procedures of high musical art with the taste of popular culture.” 
     
    - source: Gaudeamus Week – Musical Pointers about performance of Network Slammer
      issue: September 2004
      content: “Zack Browning's absorbingly entertaining Network Slammer for flute and tape. Zack's piece is direct and clear on first acquaintance, but one to hear again and again for the sheer pleasure of familiarity; based on The Magic Square of Venus (Agrippa), but nothing like Maxwell Davies - an electroacoustic work to wake up and delight the audience for any type of concert.” 
     
    - source: San Antonio Express News about performance of Network Slammer
      issue: September 17, 2006
      content: “Zack Browning's Network Slammer, which uses the numerical magic square as a compositional model, showed that process-oriented music, a frequently dour obsession of the 1970s, can be great fun.  The live flutist spun intricate melodic lines against a banging computer part that alternated between a cockeyed robotic dance and more rhythmically supple and energetic material. The four-channel electronic sounds brought to mind the beloved Hammond B3, and they filled the space richly.”
